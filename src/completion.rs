//! What the editor offers while you type.
//!
//! gpui-component's input already owns the whole completion surface — the
//! popup under the caret, its scroll, the arrow keys, `enter` to accept and
//! `escape` to dismiss — behind one trait with two required methods. None of
//! it needs a language server; `lsp_types` is only the vocabulary. So this
//! module is the part that is Slate's: which identifiers are worth offering
//! for the text in front of the cursor.
//!
//! Everything offered comes from the catalog the explorer already loaded, so
//! the popup can never name a relation the tree does not show. Nothing here
//! runs SQL and nothing here edits the buffer: an accepted row is a
//! [`TextEdit`] over the word being typed, and the input applies it.
//!
//! **This is a lexer, not a parser.** Which identifiers make sense at a
//! caret is decided by the last keyword before it and by the relations named
//! in the statement, both found by scanning tokens. A parse tree would be the
//! principled answer and is the wrong tool here: half-typed SQL is a parse
//! error by definition — `SELECT * FROM ` is exactly the text a user most
//! wants completed and exactly the text `tree_sitter_sequel` returns an
//! `ERROR` node for. The one job a scan genuinely cannot do is know it is
//! inside a string literal, and [`suppressed`] does that job on its own.
